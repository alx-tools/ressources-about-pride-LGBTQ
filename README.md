# Ressources about Pride and the LGBTQ+ community üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà

Because sometimes, you don't know, what you just don't know, the Holberton community has put together a list of resources to learn more about the LGBTQ+ community. The list contains books, podcasts, movies and people to follow so that you can learn with the media that works best for you!

Feel free to push PR so that we can make the list event better!
